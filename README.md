Files

Control 2.ctl
Description: Control definition file used in the project. Contains user interface controls and configurations.
Usage: Imported into LabVIEW to define control elements in the user interfaces.

LogFile.txt
Description: Text file used for logging events, errors, or other important information during program execution.
Usage: Review this file for debugging and tracking runtime data.

SecurityUserInterface.vi
Description: LabVIEW Virtual Instrument (VI) that provides the user interface for security-related functions.
Usage: Open this VI in LabVIEW to access and modify security settings and controls.

SensorSimulationTool.vi
Description: LabVIEW VI for simulating sensor data. Useful for testing and development without real sensor input.
Usage: Run this VI to simulate sensor data and observe how the system responds.

Users.txt
Description: Text file containing user information, such as usernames and roles, for the application.
Usage: Edit this file to manage user access and roles within the system.

Instructions

Open LabVIEW: Launch LabVIEW on your computer.
Import Control Files: Open Control 2.ctl within LabVIEW to integrate control elements into your VIs.
Load VIs: Open SecurityUserInterface.vi and SensorSimulationTool.vi in LabVIEW to view and interact with the respective functionalities.
Review Logs: Check LogFile.txt for logging information and debugging purposes.
Manage Users: Edit Users.txt as needed to manage user credentials and roles.
Usage Tips
Ensure that all files are in the same directory or properly referenced in your LabVIEW project.
Regularly review LogFile.txt for any issues or performance data.
Use SensorSimulationTool.vi for testing scenarios without needing actual sensors.
